# Photo Location Viewer
EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) files store important data about photographs. Almost all digital cameras create these data files each time you snap a new picture. An EXIF file holds all the information about the image itself. **Mimoza** is a Python application that extracts location data from photo EXIF metadata and visualizes it on an interactive map.
